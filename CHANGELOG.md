## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.3.3] – 2026-02-28 — Fix RUST_LOG documentation

### Fixed
- **README `RUST_LOG` example** — `RUST_LOG=tower_http=debug` was documented as the way
  to get verbose HTTP logs, but a target-specific directive alone silently suppresses all
  other log targets (including the endpoint's own startup lines). Corrected to
  `RUST_LOG=info,tower_http=debug` with an explanatory note.

---

## [0.3.2] – 2026-02-28 — Endpoint version banner + request logging

### Added
- **Version banner at startup** — `networker-endpoint` now prints its version (e.g.
  `networker-endpoint v0.3.2`) as the first log line before the listening-address lines.
- **HTTP request/response logging** — `TraceLayer` (from `tower-http`) added to the axum
  router; every request is logged at `INFO` with method + URI, and every response with
  status code + latency. Verbosity is controlled by `RUST_LOG`
  (e.g. `RUST_LOG=info,tower_http=debug` for verbose HTTP spans).

---

## [0.3.1] – 2026-02-28 — webdownload/webupload path rewrite

### Fixed
- **`webdownload` and `webupload` path rewrite** — both probes previously left the URL path
  unchanged (e.g. `/health`), so `webdownload` returned whatever the target endpoint happened
  to respond with (e.g. 114 B health JSON) and `webupload` POSTed to a path that ignored the
  request body. Both probes now rewrite the URL path identically to their non-web counterparts:
  `webdownload` → `GET /download?bytes=N`, `webupload` → `POST /upload`. The `--target` flag
  may point at any path; the host and port are preserved and the path is replaced.
- **`--payload-sizes` now required for `webdownload`** — updated CLI help text to document that
  `webdownload` requires `--payload-sizes` (same as `download`), since it now issues a
  `?bytes=N` request and must have a size to request.

---

## [0.3.0] – 2026-02-28 — Web probes, UDP throughput, statistics

> Starting from this release every PR includes a version bump.
> Standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) is used:
> new features → MINOR bump, bug fixes → PATCH bump.

### Fixed
- **`webdownload` ignored `--payload-sizes`** — the mode previously ran once per cycle
  and GETed the target URL as-is, returning whatever the server happened to send (e.g. 114 B
  for a `/health` endpoint). `webdownload` now expands per payload size exactly like `download`,
  and appends `?bytes=N` to the target URL so that any server that supports the parameter (such
  as `networker-endpoint`'s `/download` route) will stream back the requested number of bytes.
  The actual body bytes received are always used for the throughput calculation.
  `--payload-sizes` is now required for `webdownload` (same as `download`).
- **`webupload` absurd throughput when server ignores the request body** — generic targets
  (e.g. a `/health` endpoint) may respond immediately without draining the POST body, making
  `ttfb_ms` near-zero and the computed throughput physically impossible (e.g. 1.3M MB/s).
  `webupload` now uses a dedicated `patch_webupload_throughput` helper that (a) falls back to
  `total_duration_ms` instead of `ttfb_ms` when no `Server-Timing: recv` header is present,
  and (b) caps results at 100,000 MB/s (≈ 800 Gbps — physically impossible on any real link);
  values above the cap are reported as `null`/`—` instead. Four new unit tests cover the
  server-recv, fallback, implausible, and plausible cases.
- **`webdownload`/`webupload` probes always failed** — `run_probe` in the HTTP runner only
  listed `Http1 | Http2 | Tcp | Download | Upload`; both web-probe variants fell through to the
  `other =>` error arm, returning "Protocol not handled by http runner" on every attempt.
  Added `WebDownload | WebUpload` to both match arms (`run_probe` entry point and the
  `send_http1` dispatch inside `run_http_or_tcp`).
- Clippy `redundant_closure` in `html.rs` (`.map(|b| format_bytes(b))`) and `main.rs`
  (`.filter_map(|a| primary_metric_value(a))`); both replaced with the bare function reference.
- Integration test `ServerConfig` initializer missing `udp_throughput_port` field (added in
  the `udpdownload`/`udpupload` PR but not reflected in the test harness).

### Added
- **`udpdownload` probe mode** — bulk UDP download from `networker-endpoint`'s UDP throughput
  server (default port 9998); measures datagrams sent/received, packet loss %, transfer window
  ms, and throughput MB/s. Requires `--payload-sizes`.
- **`udpupload` probe mode** — bulk UDP upload to `networker-endpoint`'s UDP throughput server;
  server reports bytes actually received (CMD_REPORT) so client-side and server-side counts are
  compared. Requires `--payload-sizes`.
- **UDP throughput protocol** — new custom datagram protocol (`b"NWKT"` magic) over a separate
  port. Control packets: CMD_DOWNLOAD, CMD_UPLOAD, CMD_DONE, CMD_ACK, CMD_REPORT. Data packets
  have 8-byte header (seq_num + total_seqs) + up to 1400-byte payload.
- **`UdpThroughputResult`** — new JSON field on `RequestAttempt`; stores remote_addr,
  payload_bytes, datagrams_sent, datagrams_received, bytes_acked, loss_percent, transfer_ms,
  throughput_mbps.
- **HTML UDP Throughput section** — new card in the report showing all UDP throughput attempts
  with loss %, throughput, and bytes-acked.
- **Excel UDP Throughput sheet** — new sheet in the `.xlsx` report.
- **`networker-endpoint --udp-throughput-port`** — new CLI flag (default 9998) for the bulk
  throughput listener.
- **`networker-tester --udp-throughput-port`** — new CLI flag (default 9998) matching the
  endpoint default.
- **`webdownload` probe mode** — GET the target URL as-is (no endpoint path rewriting),
  measures full HTTP phase timing (DNS, TCP, TLS, TTFB, Total) + response body throughput
  + TCP kernel stats. Works with any HTTP server, not just `networker-endpoint`.
- **`webupload` probe mode** — POST to the target URL with a payload body (requires
  `--payload-sizes`), measures full HTTP phase timing + upload throughput + TCP kernel
  stats. Works with any HTTP server.
- Both new modes appear in the HTML Throughput table, TCP Stats card, All Attempts table,
  and Excel Throughput sheet alongside the existing `download`/`upload` modes.
- **TCP Stats card in HTML report** — new section showing all per-connection kernel
  stats: local→remote addresses, MSS, RTT, RTT variance, min RTT, cwnd, ssthresh,
  retransmits, total retransmits, receive window, segments out/in, delivery rate (MB/s),
  and congestion algorithm.
- **Congestion algorithm** — `TCP_CONGESTION` getsockopt added to Linux and macOS;
  stored as `TcpResult.congestion_algorithm` (e.g. "cubic", "bbr").
- **Delivery rate** — `tcpi_delivery_rate` (Linux ≥ 4.9); bytes/sec stored as
  `TcpResult.delivery_rate_bps`; displayed as MB/s in HTML + Excel.
- **Minimum RTT** — `tcpi_min_rtt` (Linux ≥ 4.9); ms stored as `TcpResult.min_rtt_ms`.
- **segs_out / segs_in** — now populated on Linux ≥ 4.2 (were always `None` previously);
  switched from `libc::tcp_info` struct to raw byte-offset reads so all kernel-version-
  gated fields work without a matching libc struct definition.
- `sql/07_MoreTcpStats.sql` — idempotent `ALTER TABLE` adding `CongestionAlgorithm`,
  `DeliveryRateBps`, `MinRttMs` columns to `dbo.TcpResult`.
- Excel TCP Stats sheet gains **Min RTT ms**, **Delivery MB/s**, **Congestion** columns.
- **Statistics Summary** — per-protocol descriptive statistics (N, Min, Mean, p50, p95, p99,
  Max, StdDev) computed from each run's primary metric (total duration ms for HTTP/TCP, RTT avg
  ms for UDP echo, throughput MB/s for all bulk-transfer modes). Shown in three places: (#35)
  - Terminal: second table printed below the existing averages table.
  - HTML report: new "Statistics Summary" card (between Timing Breakdown and UDP Probe
    Statistics); success % column colour-coded green/amber/red.
  - Excel: new "Statistics" sheet (sheet 2, directly after Summary).
- `metrics.rs`: new public `Stats` struct, `compute_stats()`, `primary_metric_label()`, and
  `primary_metric_value()` functions; 3 new unit tests for the percentile calculations. (#35)

## [0.2.5] – 2026-02-28 — Install script fixes

### Fixed
- `install.sh`: revert curl URL from `raw.githubusercontent.com` back to public Gist —
  `raw.githubusercontent.com` returns 404 for private repos without authentication. (#29)

### Added
- `.github/workflows/sync-gist.yml`: auto-patches the Gist via GitHub API whenever
  `install.sh` changes on `main`. Requires `GIST_TOKEN` secret (PAT with `gist` scope). (#29)

---

## [0.2.4] – 2026-02-28 — Versioning display + install hardening

### Added
- `networker-endpoint` emits `X-Networker-Server-Version` on every response via the
  `add_server_timestamp` middleware. (#26)
- `ServerTimingResult` gains `server_version: Option<String>` — captured in JSON per attempt. (#26)
- Terminal summary prints both **Client version** and **Server version** rows. (#26)
- HTML report Run Summary card shows Client and Server version rows. (#26)
- Version logged at tester startup. (#26)
- `CHANGELOG.md` added following Keep a Changelog format. (#27)

### Changed
- Workspace version bumped to `0.2.4` in `Cargo.toml` — cascades to both binaries. (#26)

### Fixed
- Upload throughput showed absurdly high values (millions of MB/s) because `total_duration_ms`
  includes receiving the server's JSON response body — noise unrelated to the upload transfer.
  `ttfb_ms` is now the primary denominator: it starts just before `send_request()` and stops
  when the server sends response headers. Because `networker-endpoint` only responds after
  draining the full body, `ttfb_ms ≈ upload wire time`. Formula: `max(server_recv_ms, ttfb_ms)`. (#25)
- `install.sh`: added `--force` to `cargo install` so every run unconditionally rebuilds the
  binary, preventing a stale binary when cargo's git-SHA cache considers the installed rev
  current. (#28)
- `install.sh`: prints the installed version at the end (e.g. `networker-tester 0.2.4`)
  for immediate confirmation. (#28)

---

## [0.2.3] – 2026-02-27 — Upload throughput: max() guard

### Fixed
- Upload throughput: changed denominator from `server_recv_ms.unwrap_or(total_duration_ms)`
  to `max(server_recv_ms, total_duration_ms)` so the larger (correct) value is always used.
  Prevents near-zero `server_recv_ms` (kernel-buffer race on same-machine connections) from
  producing absurdly high throughput values. (#24)

---

## [0.2.2] – 2026-02-27 — Throughput unit tests

### Added
- Full unit test coverage for all throughput calculation paths in `runner/throughput.rs`. (#23)

---

## [0.2.1] – 2026-02-27 — Upload throughput: server-side timing

### Fixed
- Upload throughput: switched denominator to `server_recv_ms` from `Server-Timing: recv;dur=X`
  header — the time the server spent draining the request body, accurate regardless of network
  path. (#22)

---

## [0.2.0] – 2026-02-27 — Extended metrics: TCP kernel stats, retries, server timing, Excel

### Added
- **TCP kernel stats** — 8 new fields on `TcpResult`: `retransmits`, `total_retrans`, `snd_cwnd`,
  `snd_ssthresh`, `rtt_variance_ms`, `rcv_space`, `segs_out`, `segs_in`.
  - Linux: read via `TCP_INFO` socket option (no root required).
  - macOS: read via `TCP_CONNECTION_INFO` (`tcp_connection_info` struct at `IPPROTO_TCP` opt `0x24`).
- **Application-level retries** — `--retries N` CLI flag; failed probes are retried up to N times;
  `retry_count` field added to `RequestAttempt`.
- **Server timing** — `ServerTimingResult` struct captures `Server-Timing` header fields (`recv`,
  `proc`, `total`), `X-Networker-Server-Timestamp`, clock skew estimate, and echoed
  `X-Networker-Request-Id`.
- **Excel output** — `--excel` CLI flag; generates an `.xlsx` report alongside JSON + HTML using
  `rust_xlsxwriter`. 8 sheets: Summary, HTTP Timings, TCP Stats, TLS Details, UDP Stats,
  Throughput, Server Timing, Errors.
- **Privilege notice** — on Linux without root, a startup message explains which metrics are still
  captured vs. what would require elevated privileges.
- **`networker-endpoint` server timing** — `/download` returns `Server-Timing: proc;dur=X`;
  `/upload` returns `Server-Timing: recv;dur=X` and echoes `X-Networker-Request-Id`.
- **SQL migrations** — `sql/05_ExtendedTcpStats.sql` (8 new `TcpResult` columns + `RetryCount`
  on `RequestAttempt`) and `sql/06_ServerTiming.sql` (`ServerTimingResult` table). (#21)

---

## [0.1.0] – 2026-02-27 — Initial release

### Added
- **Workspace** — Cargo workspace with two crates: `networker-tester` (CLI) and
  `networker-endpoint` (server).
- **Probe modes** — `http1`, `http2`, `tcp`, `udp`, `download`, `upload`;
  HTTP/3 gated behind `--features http3`.
- **Per-phase timing** — DNS, TCP connect, TLS handshake, TTFB, total; measured using raw
  `hyper 1.x` connection APIs.
- **TLS** — `rustls 0.23` with `ring` provider; self-signed cert via `rcgen`; `--insecure` flag.
- **UDP echo** — configurable probe count, RTT percentiles, jitter, loss%.
- **Download/upload throughput probes** — `GET /download?bytes=N` and `POST /upload`.
- **Output formats** — JSON, HTML report (embedded CSS, protocol comparison tables),
  SQL Server via `tiberius`.
- **`networker-endpoint`** — axum-based server; routes: `/health`, `/echo`, `/download`,
  `/upload`, `/delay`, `/headers`, `/status/:code`, `/http-version`, `/info`;
  ALPN HTTP/1.1 + HTTP/2; `Server-Timing` headers; `X-Networker-Request-Id` echo.
- **SQL Server schema** — `dbo.TestRun`, `dbo.RequestAttempt`, `dbo.HttpResult`, `dbo.TcpResult`,
  `dbo.TlsResult`, `dbo.UdpResult`, `dbo.ThroughputResult`, `dbo.ServerTimingResult`;
  stored procedures; sample queries.
- **CI** — GitHub Actions on Ubuntu + Windows; `cargo test`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`.
- **Installation script** — public Gist serves `install.sh`; compiles from private repo via SSH.
